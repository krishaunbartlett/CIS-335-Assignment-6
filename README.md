# CIS-335-Assignment-6
Implementation of SIC-XE assembler for Assignment 6

The following tasks still need to be completed:
 - Implement BYTE in pass 2 (using C'string' and X'hex')
 - Verify that integer arguments cannot be used in BYTE
 - Implement the '=' operand prefix
 - Verify that the length of object codes can change (specifically, always equal to the length of their format)
